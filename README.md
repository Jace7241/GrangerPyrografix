# _CS50 FINAL PROJECT_

#### _This is a personal art porfolio website, made using CS50 IDE, Atom, Bootstrap, and JQuery._
#### _Some functions of this website include -_

    * The distribution, and use of information, regarding an artist and their art.
    * The ability to inform a possible customer about availible artwork customizations.
    * The user is able to be directed to the artists Instagram page through the about tab.
    * The ability of a user to view artwork in the portfolio tab.

#### _My references and resources are as listed below -_

    * Bootstrap CSS for a majority, if not all of the CSS refrences.
    * [Initial inspiration for my project] (https://cs50-final-project-blog.herokuapp.com/about/)
    * [Portfolio reference] (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_portfolio_gallery.asp)
    * [Contact page reference] (https://theartistmarket.co/artist-contact-page/)
    * [Do's and Don'ts of art webpages] (https://www.artbusiness.com/weberrors.html)
    * W3 Schools was a tremendous help when I got stuck as well.

#### _Possible Improvements -_

    * Possibly add a blog type tab for user interaction.
    * Login/Logout system for users
    * Interactive portfolio, so users can comment on, or "like" the artsts work.
    *Announcments page for the artist.
